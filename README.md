# MalwareAttackProject

Malware attack- cyberattack where malicious software executes unauthorized actions on the victim's system
I will be using a shell script that the user will run on their device that will encrypt their files 

Further details:
The script will create a python file that will parse through the files in the users current directory and encrypt them
The python script will use the cryptography package, specifically the fernet module, to encrypt the contents of each of the files 
The first script should encrypt the users files and provided instructions via the readme.txt file to decrypt them
The second script will decrypt the files on the users device
